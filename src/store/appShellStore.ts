/**
 * appShellStore.ts
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Application shell state store.
 *
 * RESPONSIBILITY
 * - Manages global UI-level application state:
 *   - Active main view
 *   - Sidebar visibility
 * - Coordinates navigation across top-level views
 * Rule: App shell state never mixes with editor state.
 *
 * CONVENTIONS
 * - MUST NOT contain editor-specific state
 * - MUST NOT contain CAN runtime state
 * - MUST NOT store persistent settings
 * - SHOULD remain small and stable
 *
 * CONVENTIONS
 * - Zustand store
 * - No derived or computed state
 * - Pure UI concerns only
 *
 * HOW TO USE
 * - Import the store using `useAppStore`.
 * - Access state and methods as needed.
